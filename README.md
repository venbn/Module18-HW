## Introduction

This project is to build an Ledger application using PyChain module which records the transactions and tag them with a unique hash value.

### Step 1: Create a Record Data Class

Added a new class called `Record` within the `@dataclass` decorator and add 3 attributes `sender`, `receiver` and `amount`.

Note that youâ€™ll use this new `Record` class as the data type of your `record` attribute in the next section.

### Step 2: Modify the Existing Block Data Class to Store Record Data

Renamed `data` attribute in `Block` class to `record` which will use the new instance of `Record` class.

### Step 3: Add Relevant User Inputs to the Streamlit Interface

Deleted `input_data` variable from the streamlit interface and added input areas for `sender`, `receiver` and `amount` attributes so that inputs are accepted on the streamlit front-end application.

Added an "Add Block" button which will pickup the transaction information in the form of `record` from the `new_block`, stores the transactions, generates/tags the unique hash value (representing mined blocks) and displays them in the ledger format on the web page.

### Step 4: Test the PyChain Ledger by Storing Records

The `PyChain` ledger user interface has been testing by executing the `pychain.py` code using Streamlit application, the testing process will record the transactions and validates the blockchain.

The ledger has been tested by performing several transactions which does the following

  - Provide inputs for sender, receiver and amount attributes several times and stores/displays the blocks 
  - Verify the block contents and hashes in the Streamlit dropdown menu. 

Below is the video-screenshot of the streamlit application page has been taken which records the multiple transactions and blocks :
